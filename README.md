Welcome to SaylorScope, the tool that turns Michael Saylor's financial wisdom into your personal wealth-building companion.

## What's This Sorcery? üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

SaylorScope is your digital financial advisor (minus the expensive suits and confusing jargon). It helps you:

- Calculate asset lifespans 
- Determine ROI (Investment, not Insanity in case you were wondering)
- Figure out how long it'll take to double your money 
- Visualize your financial future with pretty charts (because who doesn't love a good graph?)

## Getting Started: No Magic Wand Required ü™Ñ

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.17.0+) - Think of it as the fuel for our financial rocket ship
- A sense of humor (optional, but highly recommended)

### Installation: As Easy as 1, 2, 3... 4

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chepenik/saylorscope.git
   ```
2. Enter the financial matrix:
   ```bash
   cd saylorscope
   ```
3. Summon the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. If step 3 throws a tantrum, try:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   ```

### Launch the Money Machine üöÄ

Editing the Project
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. I personally code in Cursor pro and it makes it much easier to add changes. Do recommend :D

Feel free to fork and make your own version. The easiest way to deploy your own Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/
Then, point your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and watch the magic unfold.

## Features: More Than Just a Pretty Interface

- Asset Comparison: Digital, physical, financial - we don't discriminate
- AI-Powered Estimates: Because sometimes, even humans need a little artificial help
- Long-term Projections: See into your financial future (crystal ball not included)
- Customizable Charts: Make your financial data as colorful as your dreams (if you are on a desktop)

## The Future is Bright (and Potentially Profitable)

We're not stopping here. Our roadmap includes:

- Mobile Optimization: For financial analysis on-the-go and pretty much most computer users. Mobile is hands down the biggest compute platform
- User Accounts: Save your assets (the digital kind) for later
- More Metrics: Because you can never have too much data
- Export Options: Spreadsheet enthusiasts, rejoice!
- A Paid Version: With more bells, whistles, and direct connections to financial data sources. (Some might say but this is open source that means there is no moat? To them i say "GOOD, that means competition")

## A Tip of the Hat üé©

A massive thank you to Michael Saylor, whose insights at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference sparked this project. May your Bitcoin always moon and your fiat always... well, do whatever fiat does.

Remember, in the world of finance, knowledge is power. And power is money. And money is power. It's a whole cycle thing.

Now go forth and calculate! üí∞üìäüöÄ
